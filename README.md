# Application-for-ETF-Analysis-Assignment7 Challenge
## Application for ETF Analysis
## Background
In recent years, finance has had an explosion in passive investing. Passive investing means that you invest in a basket of assets that’s called an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This way, you don’t spend time researching individual stocks or companies or take the risk of investing in a single stock. ETFs offer more diversification.

In this Challenge assignment, you’ll build a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voilà library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF.

## Instructions:

Use the etf_analyzer.ipynb notebook to complete your analysis of a fintech ETF that consists of four stocks: GOST, GS, PYPL, and SQ. Each stock has its own table in the etf.db database, which the Starter_Code folder contains.

Analyze the daily returns of the ETF stocks both individually and as a whole. Then deploy the visualizations to a web application by using the Voilà library.

The detailed instructions are divided into the following parts:

- Analyze a single asset in the ETF

- Optimize data access with advanced SQL queries

- Analyze the ETF portfolio

- Deploy the notebook as a web application

## Deploy the Notebook as a Web Application

For this part of the assignment, complete the following steps:

Use the Voilà library to deploy your notebook as a web application. You can deploy the web application locally on your computer.

Steps:

- Run the command "voila etf_analyzer.ipynb" in gitbash/terminal
